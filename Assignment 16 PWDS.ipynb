    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is designed to be scalable, flexible, and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational model for organizing data. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as document-based, key-value, column-family, or graph-based, to store and retrieve data. Non-relational databases are often preferred over relational databases for their scalability, flexibility, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, such as in web applications, social media, or mobile apps. Some of the key reasons to use MongoDB over SQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexibility: MongoDB's document-oriented data model allows for more flexible and dynamic data schemas than traditional relational databases, which require pre-defined tables and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, allowing for high availability and performance even under heavy loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance: MongoDB's indexing and querying capabilities allow for fast and efficient retrieval of data, even with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Development speed: MongoDB's flexible data model and query language can allow for faster development cycles and more agile development processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is a powerful and flexible database solution that is well-suited for a wide range of use cases, especially those that require flexibility, scalability, and performance."

    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers a number of features that make it a powerful and flexible database solution. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which allows for more flexible and dynamic data schemas than traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High availability: MongoDB is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant, with built-in support for replication and automatic failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Horizontal scaling: MongoDB can scale horizontally across multiple servers, allowing for high availability and performance even under heavy loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing and querying: MongoDB's indexing and querying capabilities allow for fast and efficient retrieval of data, even with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Aggregation framework: MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework allows for complex data analysis and reporting, including group-by and map-reduce operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Full-text search: MongoDB includes built-in support for full-text search, which allows for powerful and flexible text search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Geospatial indexing: MongoDB supports geospatial indexing and querying, which allows for powerful location-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. GridFS: MongoDB includes GridFS, a file storage system that allows for the storage and retrieval of large files, such as images or videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's features make it a powerful and flexible database solution that can be used for a wide range of use cases, from web applications to big data analytics."
