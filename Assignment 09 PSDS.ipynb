    "Answer.  The main goal of the abstract base class is to provide a standardized way to test whether an object adheres to a given specification. It can also prevent any attempt to instantiate a subclass that doesn’t override a particular method in the superclass. And finally, using an abstract class, a class can derive identity from another class without any object inheritance.\n",

Let’s understand through the below code."
